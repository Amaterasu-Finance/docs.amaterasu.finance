# üîê Vaults

Amaterasu Finance will offer the first auto-compounding vaults on the Aurora blockchain.

The vaults are modelled after Polycat and they are also fully functional on [FarmersOnly](https://app.farmersonly.fi/vaults) (on Harmony blockchain)

### Vault Benefits

#### 1) Simple vs Compound interest

To maximize your gains, you need to be compounding all the rewards you get from farming back into the farm. Below you can find an example of compounding over the period of a year

* APR = Simple interest
* APY = Compound&#x20;

#### 2) Auto-compounding vaults

The vaults on Amaterasu are auto-compounding. And due to low transaction fees on Aurora, the protocol can do this quite often for you therefore, maximizing your gains!

This is an example of what compounding manually would look like on Sushiswap on the Harmony blockchain for 1ETH/1USDC:

1. Harvest rewards, receiving SUSHI and WONE
2. Sell 1/2 SUSHI for 1ETH
3. Sell 1/2 SUSHI for 1USDC
4. Sell 1/2 WONE for 1ETH
5. Sell 1/2 WONE for 1USDC
6. Use the new 1ETH and 1USDC to create the 1ETH/1USDC LP Token
7. Deposit LP Token back into Farm
8. Handle the leftover dust from creating the LP token

This is quite tedious and time-consuming. The Amaterasu vaults do all of this for you quite seamlessly!

#### 3) IRL taxes

In some countries (like the US), every transaction is considered a taxable event. This is quite bad for yield farmers especially if you want to compound. However, with vaults, all you need to do is account for depositing and withdrawing. This is a huge bonus for tax accounting for DeFi protocols.

0.0% - Deposit fee

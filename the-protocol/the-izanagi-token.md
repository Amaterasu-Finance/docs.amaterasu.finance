### Tracking information

You can track the IZA token in the following places:

* TBA

### Fees & allocations for the team

10% of the collected rewards are sent to the treasury address.

The accrued fees will be used for marketing, further develpment and partnerships.

### Tokenomics

* The IZANAGI token has an uncapped supply in order to allow for future expansion of the protocol
* The initial LP will come from the teams' personal wallets (the amounts paired will be announced as we get closer to launch)
* The emissions of the token will be higher at launch and they will gradually decrease as the protocol grows in order to avoid negative price pressure. We will also have occasional events when the emissions will be increased.

### Emissions

The emissions for IZA will be higher at launch and they will decrease as time goes on. The reasoning behind this is to attract new investors into the MTV ecosystem and build a strong community.

{% hint style="success" %}
Please note that we will potentially increase emissions at certain points in time for special events. A typical example would be: for the 1 year aniversary of Amaterasu emissions will be temporairly increased to 0.05 again.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
The schedule below is just an indication and even though we want to adhere to it 100%, we also want to retain the right to adjust emissions down/up and deviate from the schedule if necessary.

### Tokenomics

* The IZANAGI token has an uncapped supply in order to allow for future expansion of the protocol
* The initial LP will come from the teams' personal wallets (the amounts paired will be announced as we get closer to launch)
* The emissions of the token will be higher at launch and they will gradually decrease as the protocol grows in order to avoid negative price pressure. We will also have occasional events when the emissions will be increased.

### Emissions

The emissions for IZA will be higher at launch and they will decrease as time goes on. The reasoning behind this is to attract new investors into the Aurora ecosystem and build a strong community.

{% hint style="success" %}
Please note that we will potentially increase emissions at certain points in time for special events. A typical example would be: for the 1 year aniversary of Amaterasu emissions will be temporairly increased to 0.025 again.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
The schedule below is just an indication and even though we want to adhere to it 100%, we also want to retain the right to adjust emissions down/up and deviate from the schedule if necessary.

### Team & marketing allocation

On top of the normal emissions of IZA, 15% will be added on top of which 10% is allocated to the team and 5% to marketing, mods and partnerships

#### A simple example would look something like this:

In the first week the emissions are 0.05 IZA/block. 15% on top would be 0.0075 IZA/block extra. 0.005 IZA/block would be distributed to the team members (proportionate to their stakes in the project) and 0.0025 IZA/block would go to a wallet that will hold the funds for marketing, mods and partnerships.

{% hint style="info" %}
The teams' wallets will be made public and we will monitor each other to prevent dumping the token. We have no incentives to drop the price by selling excessively, we want to maintain the IZA token healthy and strong. We will have internal rules in place regarding price impacts of our sells.

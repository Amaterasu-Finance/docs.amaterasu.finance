# ðŸª™ The xIZANAGI token

The $xIZA token combines 3 concepts into 1:

### 1) AMM DEX Fees

By staking your IZA and holding xIZA, you will get more IZA tokens as time goes on. The protocol uses 1/3 of the DEX fees to buy and deposit IZA in the xIZA vault.

The xIZA will start at a ratio of 1:1 with IZA and it will increase with time. This means that when you unstake your xIZA and go back to IZA, you will have more IZA.

The concept is similar to xSUSHI tokens.

### 2) Auto-Compounding Vault

The xIZA vault deposits the IZA into the yield farm to earn addtional IZA for xIZA holders.

### 3) Governance token

xIZA holders will be able to participate in governance voting too in the future.

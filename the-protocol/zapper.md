# âš¡ Zapper

The Zapper is a really neat feature that allows users to enter directly into a pool/vault by insta splitting their tokens in half and creating an LP.

Essentially, it cuts a few steps for you when you want to go into a pool/vault!

The Zapper uses 5% slippage by default! It will be configurable on the UI later by the user

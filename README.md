# â„¹ Introduction

Amaterasu Finance is a native DEX on the MTV chain. The governance token of the protocol is IZANAGI (ticker: $IZA)

The goal of the protocol is to be the leading DEX on MTV and attain a high TVL. The DEX will be the starting point but the team wants to expand the protocol. A few potential developments being considered are:

* Vaults
* Bonds
* Borrowing & Lending

The concept of Amaterasu Finance comes from Japanese lore. Amaterasu is the goddess of the sun in Japanese mythology and Izanagi is also a Japanese deity. Most of the Amaterasu Finance ecosystem branding takes inspiration from Japanese lore/history.

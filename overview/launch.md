# ðŸš€ Launch

The launch of Amaterasu will take place on the 31st of March at 5PM EST

For the launch of the $IZA token, we will mint some IZA tokens and we will pair them with liquidity from the team's pockets. We will be pairing 12k USD with AURORA at launch. This liquidity will be multisigged and the multisig wallet + tx will be made public.

The initial price of $IZA will be around 0.20$.

Farming will start 30 minutes after the pairing of liquidity.

The vaults will be launched soon after the start of the farming.

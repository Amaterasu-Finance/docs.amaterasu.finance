# ðŸš€ Launch

**The launch of Amaterasu has taken place on the 31st of March at 5PM EST.**

For the launch of the $IZA token, we have minted some IZA tokens and we have paired them with liquidity from the team's pockets. We paired 12k USD worth of AURORA with IZA at launch. This liquidity is multisigged and the multisig wallet can be found here.

The initial price of $IZA was around 0.20$.

Farming has started 30 minutes after the pairing of liquidity.

# ðŸ¦Š Metamask & MTV

Before you can start executing transactions on the MTV chain, you need to follow a few simple steps.

1. You need to add the MTV mainnet to your Metamask wallet. You can find the instructions [here](https://multivac-global.medium.com/how-to-access-mainnet-token-and-re-stake-f1dccea1b321).
2. You can purchase MTV tokens on a CEX (such as Kucoin) and withdraw to your Metamask on the BSC (Binance Smart Chain) chain.
3. You can bridge from BSC to MTV mainnet through the official MTV bridge [here](https://e.mtv.ac/bridge.html). (here is a video regarding bridging for the visual learners - [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qub\_-iRKrCk))
4. That's it, you're done! You can now do transactions on the MTV mainnet just like any other EVM chain.

# ðŸ¦Š Metamask & Aurora

Before you can start executing transactions on the Aurora chain, you need to follow a few simple steps.

The decentralized solution

1. You need to add the Aurora mainnet to your Metamask wallet. You can find the instructions [here.](https://aurora.dev/start)
2. You can get ETH for GAS on Aurora by going to the Aurora faucet [here.](https://aurora.dev/faucet) (you just need to have 0.05 ETH on your Metamask wallet on the Ethereum mainnet to get funds from the faucet).
3. You can bridge over to the Aurora mainnet from most chains.&#x20;

* Bridging from Harmony, Binance Smart Chain, Fantom, Avalanche or Polgyon can be done through [Synapse](https://synapseprotocol.com)
* Bridging from Ethereum or NEAR can be done through [Rainbowbridge](https://rainbowbridge.app/transfer)
* Bridging from Solana or Terra can be done through [Allbridge](https://app.allbridge.io)

That's it, you're done! You can now do transactions on the Aurora mainnet just like any other EVM chain.

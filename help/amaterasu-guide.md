# â˜€ Amaterasu guide

The first step to interacting with the Amaterasu protocol is to set up the Aurora mainnet on Metamask. You can add the Aurora mainnet [here.](https://aurora.dev/start)

1. The gas fees are in ETH, so you will need to have some ETH on Aurora. There are 2 options here, you can either request from the [Aurora faucet](https://aurora.dev/faucet) (and make sure you have 0.05 ETH on the Ethereum mainnet) or you can bridge ETH through a bridge like [Synapse ](https://synapseprotocol.com)or [Rainbow Bridge ](https://rainbowbridge.app/transfer)from the chain of your choice.

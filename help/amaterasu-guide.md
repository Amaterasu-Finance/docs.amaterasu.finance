# â˜€ Amaterasu guide

### Setting up your Metamask and getting ETH for on chain fees

The first step to interacting with the Amaterasu protocol is to set up the Aurora mainnet on Metamask. You can add the Aurora mainnet [here.](https://aurora.dev/start)

1. The gas fees are in ETH, so you will need to have some ETH on Aurora. There are 2 options here, you can either request from the [Aurora faucet](https://aurora.dev/faucet) (and make sure you have 0.05 ETH on the Ethereum mainnet) or you can bridge ETH through a bridge like [Synapse ](https://synapseprotocol.com)or [Rainbow Bridge ](https://rainbowbridge.app/transfer)from the chain of your choice.
2. Transaction fees are extremely low, even if they are in ETH.

Remember to always check the Aurora scan if you have doubts about certain transactions or something seems to be wrong. By looking at the blockchain transactions you can get a better overview of the transcations you executed.

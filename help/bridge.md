# ðŸŒ‰ Bridge

Aurora is supported by most major bridges and that creates fantastic cross-chain availability.

Before bridging, you need to add Aurora mainnet to your Metamask wallet. Check out the instructions in this section of our docs:

{% content-ref url="metamask-and-aurora.md" %}
[metamask-and-aurora.md](metamask-and-aurora.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

After getting the mainnet setup on your Metamask, you can start bridging

1. You can get ETH for GAS on Aurora by going to the Aurora faucet [here.](https://aurora.dev/faucet)&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You just need to have 0.05 ETH on your Metamask wallet on the Ethereum mainnet to get funds from the faucet.
{% endhint %}

&#x20; 2\. You can bridge over to the Aurora mainnet from most major chains.&#x20;

* Bridging from Harmony, Binance Smart Chain, Fantom, Avalanche or Polgyon can be done through [Synapse](https://synapseprotocol.com)
* Bridging from Ethereum or NEAR can be done through [Rainbowbridge](https://rainbowbridge.app/transfer)
* Bridging from Solana or Terra can be done through [Allbridge](https://app.allbridge.io)

That's it, you're done! You can now do transactions on the Aurora mainnet just like any other EVM chain.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure to always send a test transaction before sending the whole amount through the bridge.
{% endhint %}
